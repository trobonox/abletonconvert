AbletonConvert is a Tool that allows you to use Ableton Live 10.1.x Files in Version 10.0.x. This is especially useful for people who want to get better performance in Ableton Projects which don't use the new features of Live 10.1. A good example are Launchpad Covers with complex Lightshows, which get a performance boost in 10.0.x.

Please note: as there is no high demand for this software anymore, it is not being maintained. If you find a critical bug you can report it by opening an issue and it will probably get fixed.

## Getting started
Prerequisites: to run the Tool, you need to make sure that you have the .NET Core SDK/Runtime installed. You can download it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/.

-  Download the latest release: https://github.com/trobonox/AbletonConvert/releases
-  Unpack the .zip/.tar.gz
-  Open the folder you just unpacked
-  Double click **AbletonConvert** (.exe on Windows, Unix Executable on Linux - not the .dll)
-  You will get a prompt for the file path: navigate to the file you want to convert and either drag and drop it onto the converter window, or paste the full path in manually
-  Press Enter and wait until the conversion process is done. (You should get a message saying "Done.")
-  You will find the converted file in the same folder as the original file. On Linux the converted file may be found in a different folder (usually one folder above original file).

After the conversion process is done, you should be able to open the .als file in Live 10.0.x without getting any errors. (Searching for missing media files may be needed).
